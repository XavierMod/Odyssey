## Project information

Odyssey is a web full-stack social media application for adventurers, travelers… who want to share their most exciting adventures with their friends or the world. This is a University assignment forth server-side and mobile web development subjects, and with this project, I hope to demonstrate my understanding of client-side and server-side technologies for mobile web application development.

This repository only includes Front-End Development files. To run this project, the web server implementation needs to be executed on another port. 

Back-End Development Repository: https://github.com/XavierMod/Odyssey-back-end

## Using and inspecting the app

Several users and posts have been introduced in the app to test the interactivity and functionality of the app. New users can be added into the database (Google Sign Up system not included), add friends, create posts, etc. To test the interaction between users, this is the complete list of “dummy” users that have been already put in the database:

| Username      | Email                   | Password      |
